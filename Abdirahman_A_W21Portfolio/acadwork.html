        <p class="stray">The Stray No More App is the app my group and I decided on for our final<br> capstone project. It is an app that simulates a community for pet owners,<br> 
            but mainly is for people who have lost their pets in the city and people who<br> come across stray animals.
            Information is given to users on how to handle stray<br> animals. Most importantly, users are able to create 
            a profile for themselves with<br> a picture of their pet, and are able to post messages on forums with other users.<br>
            We are currently in the implementation stage of the project, with some of the<br> functionality complete.<br><br><br><br><br>Below are the projects mock ups, wireframes, reports, plans, and<br> requirements in their respective documents. </p>
