            <p>I'm a George Brown college student currently studying to become a computer programmer. I'm in my final year of studying and I am set to graduate May 2021. My skills are highest in object oriented programming with C# and Java, and web application development with frameworks such as .NET, Node, and React. As of right now, I am looking for a junior developer internship to build my experience and skills. 
            </p>
            <p class="biotitle">CAREER STATEMENT</p>
            <p>When I graduate, I would like to gain some experience in an internship role where I can grow and expand my knowledge in various aspects, not just programming. Participating in scrum meetings with colleagues, working on tasks in groups, and growing mentally. I have many motivations, a big one being being able to create my own software in hopes to create the next big thing, whether that be a game or an everyday user application. Until then though, I will gain experience and the skills needed to do so in an learning environment surrounded by mentors and colleagues. Before I call it quits on coding when I'm older, I would like to leave my presence in another form such as advanced technology , a startup company, or maybe even starting up a coding academy for young children because I believe the future lies in the hands of programming.</p>
